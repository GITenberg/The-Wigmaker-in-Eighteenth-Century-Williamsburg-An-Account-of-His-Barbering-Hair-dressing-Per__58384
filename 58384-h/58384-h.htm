<p>Richard Gamble, barber and perukemaker
of Williamsburg in the middle years
of the eighteenth century, appears to have
remained a bachelor all his life. Other than
this he seems to have been no more improvident
than the average craftsman of his time. That is to say,
he came&mdash;or was brought&mdash;into court with startling frequency
in an endless round of suits to collect unpaid debts.</p>
<p>He was in good company. Going to the law was part of
the colonial way of life in Virginia, and everyone from a
town&rsquo;s least citizen to the colony&rsquo;s greatest planter engaged
in it. In fact, suing and being sued had some of the aspects
of a game: the plaintiff in one case might shortly be defendant
in another and witness in a third&mdash;and keep right on
doing business with the other parties in all three cases!</p>
<p>Court records abound with evidence that Williamsburg
wigmakers were just as impecunious and as contentious as
any of the rest. Mr. Gamble, however, had an additional
distinction&mdash;of a sort. While most debt cases reached
settlement out of court or ended in judgment for the plaintiff,
Gamble actually went to jail for debt. In the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i> of May 8, 1752, appeared this announcement to the
public:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>BEING prevented carrying on my Business as usual
by an Arrest for a Debt not justly my own. I hereby
give Notice, That I have taken into Partnership with
me <i>Edward Charlton</i>, late from <i>London</i>, who will carry
on the Business, at my Shop, next Door to the <i>Raleigh</i>
Tavern, in <i>Williamsburg</i>. Gentlemen, who please to
favour us with their Orders for Wigs, &amp;c. may depend
on being well and expeditiously serv&rsquo;d and oblige</p>
<p><span class="lr">Their very humble Servant</span>
<span class="lr"><i>Richard Gamble</i>.</span></p>
<p><i>N. B.</i> All Persons who are indebted to me, are desired
to pay the same to Mr. <i>Alexander Finnie</i>, who is
properly impowered for that Perpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander Finnie, co-defendant with Gamble in at least
one large suit for debt&mdash;perhaps the one that led to Gamble&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Arrest&rdquo;&mdash;was himself a wigmaker who had abandoned the
craft for the arduous pleasures of innkeeping. He was
proprietor at the time of the Raleigh Tavern, Williamsburg&rsquo;s
largest and most famous hostelry.</p>
<p>When Gamble died, Edward Charlton, late from London,
succeeded to the business and became in time Williamsburg&rsquo;s
leading barber and wigmaker. His livelihood&mdash;as perhaps
he foresaw&mdash;was already doomed when he retired from
business shortly before the Revolution: the wig fashion was
on the way out in England and would soon be dropped in
America. And in any case his former clientele would vanish
from the streets of Williamsburg when the capital of Virginia
was moved to Richmond in 1780.</p>
<p>Charlton, Gamble, and Finnie were only three of some
thirty men concerned with barbering and wigmaking in
eighteenth-century Williamsburg. Once or twice between
1700 and 1780 the town apparently had to struggle along
for short periods with but a single active practitioner of the
craft. Usually there were at least two or three, and for a
time in 1769 as many as eight plied their trade in the little
capital city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>About some of these thirty or more men we know nothing
today except their names. About others quite a few facts
survive in one place or another, chiefly the records of the
York County Court and the columns of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>.
In addition, Edward Charlton&rsquo;s account book of sales made
and payments received during the years 1769 to about 1775
(there are some later entries) was found in the attic of a
Williamsburg home only a few years ago. It helps immensely
to round out our knowledge of his craft and clientele, and
makes him almost inevitably the &ldquo;representative&rdquo; of his
fellows in this account.</p>

</div>
<p>All of these Williamsburg barbers and perukemakers performed
at least one, but not always all three, of the craft&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
basic services: (1) making, selling, and dressing wigs and
false hair pieces for men and women; (2) cutting and dressing
men&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s, and children&rsquo;s natural hair; and (3)
shaving men. Before we go into more detail on these aspects
of the craft in colonial days, however, it may be well to peer
briefly still further back into history.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>BEARDS, WIGS, AND HISTORY</i></span></h2>
<p>The trouble with hair is that it persists in growing, and
every once in a while something must be done about it. Over
the millenia since time began&mdash;or at least since people began&mdash;that
&ldquo;something&rdquo; has been manifold in variety: dyeing,
bleaching, oiling, powdering, pomading, trimming, curling,
straightening, shaving off completely, or augmenting with
hair from horses, cows, goats, and from other human heads.</p>
<p>Shaving the face was not customary among the ancient
Greeks until Alexander the Great ordered his soldiers to
doff their beards lest the enemy use them as a convenient
handle in close combat. Thereupon the Grecian tonsorial
parlor, known as a <i>tonstrina</i>, added shaving to its previous
services of trimming and dressing the hair and beard, massage,
first aid, and minor surgery.</p>
<p>Roman barbers (the word comes from the Latin <i>barba</i> for
beard) followed the example of their Greek colleagues when
the beard passed out of favor during the Republic. The
classic reply of the Roman general Archelaus rings true even
today: asked by a talkative barber how he would like to be
trimmed, Archelaus answered, according to Plutarch, &ldquo;In
silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the onslaught of the barbarians (a word that comes
not from <i>barba</i>, but from the Greek <i>barbaros</i>, meaning
strange or rude) until about the thirteenth century, the
craft of barbering probably reverted in most of Europe to
its elementary procedures of trimming and dressing the hair
and beard. In the latter century the first guilds of barbers
were formed in both France and England, and by the seventeenth
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
century the golden age of the barber had begun.</p>
<p>For most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in
Europe an inordinate emphasis on appearance led to excesses
of fashion in both costume and hairdress. Men followed the
vagaries of high fashion as faithfully as women, and vied
with each other in wearing long curls of their own or somebody
else&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>The wearing of wigs, at least for special purposes, was of
ancient origin. Wigs have been found on Egyptian mummies;
Greek actors wore wigs on stage; fashionable ladies of
Rome and Carthage were much addicted to false hair&mdash;especially
golden locks from Teuton heads. But the widespread
wearing of perukes as an everyday article of costume
is generally held to date from 1624, when Louis XIII
adopted the usage.</p>
<p>Here it needs to be said, perhaps, that &ldquo;wig&rdquo; and &ldquo;peruke&rdquo;
are not different styles but different forms of the same word.
The French <i>perruque</i>, spelled <i>peruke</i> in England and the
colonies, had gone through an earlier series of English transformations:
from <i>perwyke</i> to <i>perewyk</i> to <i>periwig</i>, and then
by abbreviation to <i>wig</i>.</p>
<p>Although Louis XIV disdained wigs until his abundant
natural hair began to fall out, the fashion flourished at his
court and was brought over to England by the restored
Charles II, who began in 1663 to affect a large black wig.
Charles may have been the first English king to adopt the
custom, but it is said that Elizabeth I owned some 80
auburn, orange, and gold wigs to cover her thinning hair.</p>
<p>Just as Louis XIII&rsquo;s courtiers hastened to don wigs as
soon as their monarch did, so aspiring ladies and gentlemen
of Restoration England emulated their king. Samuel Pepys
recorded that his wife first acquired &ldquo;a pair of peruques of
hair, as the fashion now is for ladies to wear; which are
pretty, and are of my wife&rsquo;s own hair, or else I should not
endure them.&rdquo; Then, after great hesitation, he bought a
&ldquo;periwigg&rdquo; for himself and had his hair cut off and made
into another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Pepys&rsquo;s final word on the subject was to wonder &ldquo;what will
be the fashion after the plague is done, as to periwiggs, for
nobody will dare to buy any haire, for fear of the infection,
that it had been cut off the heads of people dead of the
plague.&rdquo; He need not have been concerned on that score;
the fashion throve better after the plague than before, attaining
its greatest development under Queen Anne, when
the long curls of men&rsquo;s full-bottomed wigs covered the back
and shoulders and floated down over the chest. In France,
according to Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopedia</i> (published 1751-1772),
late seventeenth-century <i>perruques</i> were so long and so
much adorned that they commonly weighed as much as
two pounds and cost more than 1,000 <i>ecus</i> (silver coins about
the size of a dollar).</p>
<p>Milady&rsquo;s hairdress reached even more preposterous extremes
in the many-tiered and bejewelled &ldquo;fontanges&rdquo; of
Louis XIV&rsquo;s court (an exaggeration he disapproved in vain)
about 1700. After a period of some moderation the style
reappeared in the yard-high &ldquo;heads&rdquo; dictated to fashion by
Marie Antoinette before she lost hers. If English and
colonial women did not go to the extreme, they nevertheless
followed the style. A letter to the New York <i>Journal
or General Advertiser</i> in 1767 complained that &ldquo;it is now
the Mode to make the Lady&rsquo;s Head of twice the natural
Size, by means of artificial Pads, Boulsters, or Rolls&rdquo; which&mdash;the
writer had on good authority&mdash;came from hospital
patients dead of the smallpox and of &ldquo;a Distemper still more
disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>WIG SHOPS IN WILLIAMSBURG</i></span></h2>
<p>The shop that Richard Gamble entrusted to his new
partner in 1752 stood next door to the Raleigh Tavern, in
what was sometimes called &ldquo;the most public part of the
city.&rdquo; Certainly no better location in Williamsburg could
have been found for a barber shop than on the Duke of
Gloucester Street in the block nearest the Capitol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="654" />
<p class="pcap"><i>&ldquo;The Preposterous Head Dress, or the Feathered Lady&rdquo; is the title of this satirical print issued
in London in 1776. Contemporary accounts indicate that the artist did not greatly exaggerate
either the size or the composition of the headdresses affected by fashionable ladies in the capitals
of Europe. Colonial women seem not to have dressed their hair in such heights of fashion.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The broad main street of Williamsburg, muddy or dusty
as the season decreed, stretched westward from the Capitol
nearly a mile to the College of William and Mary. During
most of the year it saw only the normal activity of a small
colonial town. But several times each year&mdash;when the
courts and perhaps the Assembly met&mdash;the town&rsquo;s population
doubled or tripled. These &ldquo;Publick Times&rdquo; were
almost field days of litigation, commercial negotiation, and
merrymaking. Then it was that innkeepers and craftsmen
lucky enough to have located in that first block knew how
fortunate they were.</p>
<p>One small shop also near the Raleigh had been a barbering
and wigmaking establishment at least since John Peter
Wagnon bought it in 1734. It remained so through the long
ownership of Wagnon&rsquo;s one-time apprentice, Andrew Anderson,
and the short occupancy of two successor barbers and
wigmakers, William Peake of Yorktown and James Currie.
Across the street from the Raleigh had stood the shop of
Jean Pasteur, one of Williamsburg&rsquo;s first known wigmakers.
Somewhere nearby Alexander Finnie made wigs before moving
to the Raleigh itself, and Anthony Geohegan did so
later&mdash;perhaps in the same shop.</p>
<p>A little farther uptown William Peake had briefly set up
business as a barber in Mr. Dunn&rsquo;s Crown Tavern, opposite
the printing office. James Nichols first opened his shop in
&ldquo;the corner room of the brick house where Mrs. Singleton
lives&rdquo;&mdash;now better known as the Brick House Tavern. And
somewhere along the same crowded street Richard Charlton
(who was somehow related to Edward and had at least a
passing acquaintance with wigmaking) kept his well-patronized
tavern.</p>
<p>Other craftsmen also located in the same neighborhood.
Not far beyond the Raleigh hung the sign of James Craig&rsquo;s
jewelry, watch, and silversmith shop, the Golden Ball. And
next to it was the millinery store of the sisters Margaret
and Jane Hunter&mdash;the latter of whom married her neighbor
Edward Charlton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The size of Edward Charlton&rsquo;s
barber and wig shop is
now unknown. For some time
it was probably no larger than
a front room of the house he
owned opposite the Raleigh.
Andrew Anderson&rsquo;s shop was in
a building sixteen feet square.
The barber shop next to the
King&rsquo;s Arms Tavern is shown
on later insurance papers to have
been sixteen by twenty feet&mdash;and
these are the approximate
dimensions of the restored barber
and perukemaker&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="565" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The restored shop of the barber and
perukemaker in Williamsburg. It
stands on Duke of Gloucester Street
next to the King&rsquo;s Arms Tavern
and across from the Raleigh Tavern.
In dimensions, appearance, and
equipment it is believed to resemble
quite closely a shop that stood on
the site about 1770 and may have
been occupied successively by the
partnerships of Geohegan and Brazier
and of Charlton and Nichols.</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>MASTERS, SERVANTS, AND MATERIALS</i></span></h2>
<p>In such a small shop it seems
unlikely that even a leading wigmaker could have had very
many helpers. But Edward Charlton at one time had four
apprentices and journeymen, and one of his contemporaries,
Robert Lyon, in the space of two years had five known bond
servants, at least three identified as barber-wigmakers.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship to a master barber and perukemaker was
the normal&mdash;in fact the only&mdash;way for a boy to learn the
trade. The Williamsburg wigmakers presumably all entered
the craft in this manner, though Andrew Anderson is the
only one about whom the record is clear. Presumably, too,
most of them had apprentices in turn; but here the surviving
information is quite skimpy.</p>
<p>Journeymen (craftsmen who had finished their apprentice
training but had not yet gone into business as their own
masters) were in good demand and apparently in good
supply. Alexander Finnie gave notice in a 1745 issue of the
<i>Virginia Gazette</i> that he was &ldquo;in want of Two or Three
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Journeymen, that understand the Business of a Barber and
Peruke-maker,&rdquo; and promised any who applied &ldquo;good Encouragement.&rdquo;
The response to this ad was prompt, for
the very next issue of the <i>Gazette</i> contained this notice by
the master barber and wigmaker whose shop was directly
across the street from Finnie&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Whereas my honest Neighhour, that has advertis&rsquo;d for
Two or Three Journeymen, has lately seduced One from
my Service, in a clandestine and undermining Manner;
which I am well persuaded, that no Man but one of his
Principles would have done: Therefore it&rsquo;s to be hoped,
that one of the Number he has advertised for, will come
into my Service, in Lieu of him who has been so villanously
cajol&rsquo;d as above, who may depend on having good Encouragement,
from</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">Andrew Anderson.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether Anderson lured anyone into his employ by this
ad does not appear. But Finnie a year later announced
that he had just imported from London a shipment of wigmaking
materials and also &ldquo;some exceeding good Workmen.&rdquo;
With what has the ring of smug satisfaction he concluded:
&ldquo;As I have a great many good Workmen, Gentlemen and
others may depend on being speedily and faithfully served,
in the best Manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finnie&rsquo;s mention of imported materials was typical. Time
and again the announcements of Williamsburg wigmakers
contain phrases such as &ldquo;Just arrived, a choice Parcel of
Hairs, prepared by the best Hands in London,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Fresh
Cargoe of live human Hairs, already curl&rsquo;d and well prepared.&rdquo;
By far the larger portion of hair used in Williamsburg-made
wigs was imported from England, either by the
perukemaker himself or by colonial hair merchants.</p>
<p>According to Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopedia</i>, hair from regions
such as Flanders, where beer and cider were the common
beverages, made superior wigs; women&rsquo;s hair was better
than men&rsquo;s; country women&rsquo;s better than city women&rsquo;s; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
chestnut was the most desirable color&mdash;except that white
wigs should be made of hair that once had been black.
Furthermore, avowed the same authority, &ldquo;In general the
hair of persons not given to excesses lasts a long time, while
that of men who live in sexual debauchery, or of women who
give themselves to the uses of men, has less sap, dries out,
and loses its quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If colonial wigmakers were aware of this dictum&mdash;which
seems unlikely&mdash;they paid it no attention, buying hair from
abroad with never a query as to the personal habits of the
original wearers, and showing similar indifference in purchasing
local locks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE subscriber proposes purchasing <span class="sc">Hair</span> for Wigs,
and hopes he will soon be able to supply wigmakers
with that article, of different kinds. He is in want of a
quantity of human hair, both long and short, of any
colour, for which he will give one shilling per ounce, or
more, according to the quality. Apply to Mr. <i>James
Nichols</i>, barber in <i>Williamsburg</i>, who will receive it and
pay the money, or to me in <i>Petersburg</i>.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">George Long.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>COLONIAL CLIENTELE</i></span></h2>
<p>A few of the Williamsburg barbers and perukemakers advertised
their readiness to dress ladies&rsquo; hair, and Charlton
regularly made &ldquo;curls&rdquo; for his customers&rsquo; wives. But most
seem to have confined themselves wholly&mdash;or almost so&mdash;to
barbering and bewigging male clients.</p>
<p>These clients were either town dwellers or members of
the plantation gentry, who were the colony&rsquo;s economic,
political, and social elite. Of every hundred Virginians,
eighty or more were small farmers or farm workers and did
not own wigs. Devereaux Jarratt, the son of a poor but
industrious farmer near Williamsburg, recalled later in life
in his memoirs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <i>periwig</i>, in those days, was a distinguishing badge
of <i>gentle folk</i>&mdash;and when I saw a man riding the road,
near our house, with a wig on, it would so alarm my
fears, and give me such a disagreeable feeling, that, I
dare say, I would run off, as for my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="807" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Some of the tools and equipment of the barber-wigmaker, especially those used for shaving and
hair dressing. Note in particular the powdering masks in the lower right corner that covered
the faces of customers while their hair or wigs were being dusted with powder.</i> <span class="small">DIDEROT</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>And an anonymous traveler of the 1740s observed that in
Maryland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&rsquo;Tis an odd Sight, that except some of the very elevated
Sort, few Persons wear Perukes, so that you
would imagine they were all sick, or going to bed: Common
People wear Woollen and Yarn Caps; but the
better ones wear white Holland or Cotton: Thus they
travel fifty Miles from Home. It may be cooler, for
ought I know; but, methinks, &rsquo;tis very ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps on the frontier men allowed their beards to go
unshorn. In the settled areas and towns, however, only a
clean-shaven face was acceptable to the fashion that simultaneously
demanded false hair on the head. Most men
probably shaved themselves, and some, like Councillor
Robert Carter and Dr. John Sequeira, had slaves trained to
do their barbering. Of the rest a goodly number visited
Charlton&rsquo;s shop almost daily and paid him an annual fee
for &ldquo;shaving and dressing.&rdquo; We do not know if this meant
shaving the face or the head or both; &ldquo;dressing,&rdquo; of course,
normally referred to care of the wig.</p>
<p>Some among Charlton&rsquo;s regular customers for shaving and
dressing, however, never bought a wig from him. Either
they imported their own directly from a maker like Thomas
Clendinning of Glasgow, or else they wore no wig. To defy
fashion in this second manner must have taken some courage,
for the wig was an important badge of social rank,
particularly among the upper and would-be upper classes.</p>
<p>But it was not an infallible one. Negro slaves may sometimes
have been decked out in white wigs: those who were
the liveried house slaves, coachmen, and the like, of the
ostentatiously rich planters. On the other hand, such a
well-to-do and fashion-conscious man as George Washington
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
seems from portraits and other records to have worn no wig
at all, though he kept his own hair well powdered and curled.
In the lesser ranks craftsmen, indentured servants, and
apprentices sometimes did and sometimes did not wear wigs.</p>
<p>Washington, who often lodged when in Williamsburg at
the tavern of Richard Charlton, was not among Edward
Charlton&rsquo;s customers for any barbering service. Peyton
Randolph, however, the speaker of the House of Burgesses,
was an excellent patron. He bought two brown dress bob
wigs every year, and each December paid for a year&rsquo;s shaving
and dressing. John Randolph, the attorney general,
was another regular customer, who paid nothing for several
years, then settled his large bill partly in &ldquo;cash,&rdquo; partly by
&ldquo;the pardon of a Negro,&rdquo; and partly with some horses.</p>
<p>The cash receipts that Charlton entered in his accounts
may in rare instances have included clinking money. But
the colonies were forbidden to mint their own, and coin of
the realm was exceedingly scarce. So Charlton&rsquo;s income
was largely paper currency of one kind or another: perhaps
Virginia currency printed by William Hunter at the printing
office on Duke of Gloucester Street years before; perhaps
bills of exchange on a London merchant; most likely warehouse
receipts for varying amounts of stored tobacco&mdash;these
being a form of legal tender universally acceptable in
the tobacco colonies.</p>
<p>Robert Carter Nicholas, treasurer of the colony, Thomas
Everard, mayor of Williamsburg, George Mason of Gunston
Hall, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, George
Wythe, professor of law at the College, and Wythe&rsquo;s former
student, the youthful Thomas Jefferson, all visited Charlton&rsquo;s
shop more or less faithfully. Jefferson, experimenting
as usual, first bought a brown dress queue wig and then a
brown tie wig before he settled on the brown dress bob
that was the prevailing style.</p>
<p>Another of Charlton&rsquo;s famous patrons, &ldquo;Mr Patrick
Hanrey Esq<sup>re</sup>,&rdquo; bought only one peruke of him in the half-dozen
years of the account book. He brought it back once
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
for alteration, but never for dressing. Perhaps this was the
brown wig that one contemporary remembered &ldquo;exhibited
no indication of great care in the dressing.&rdquo; Another acquaintance
recalled, however, that &ldquo;at the bar of the General
Court, [Henry] always appeared in full suit of black cloth
or velvet, and a tye wig, which was dressed and powdered
in the highest style.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="414" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Part of a page from Edward Charlton&rsquo;s account book, showing purchases by Thomas
Jefferson of four wigs, two pairs of curls, three pounds of powder, and one dressing
during the years 1769 (when he came to his first session as a member of the House
of Burgesses), 1770, 1771, and 1773. Jefferson spent most of 1772, the year of his
marriage, at Monticello, letting public business and Williamsburg get along without
him.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Among the shop&rsquo;s other patrons were innkeepers, blacksmiths,
a saddler, a silversmith, printers, clergymen, physicians&mdash;indeed,
from wealthy planters like Robert Carter,
Ralph Wormeley, and John Page to such unglamorous
persons as Humphrey Harwood, plasterer and brick mason,
Charlton made wigs for them all.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>THE MOST POPULAR PERUKES</i></span></h2>
<p>The French <i>Encyclop&eacute;die Perruqui&egrave;re</i> listed 45 styles of
wig in its 1727 edition, 115 styles in that of 1764. While a
complete catalogue is impossible here, some description in
words and pictures of the most frequent varieties may assist
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
gentlemen of the twentieth century to choose (in their
mind&rsquo;s eye) the style that would suit them best. The wigs
pictured and described do not presume to share the amazing
characteristics claimed by a London maker of 1760. His
advertising avowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to ecclesiastical perukes he gives a certain demure,
sanctified air; he confers on the tye-wigs of the law an
appearance of great sagacity and deep penetration; on
those of the faculty of physick he casts a solemnity and
gravity that seems equal to the profoundest knowledge.
His military smarts ... [give] the wearer a most war-like
fierceness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for color, any style might be made up in any of the
several colors favored for wigs: black, white, grizzle (an
iron-gray mixture of black and white hair), brown, and
flaxen are mentioned most often in surviving accounts. Less
popular shades included milk white, light natural, yellowish,
pale, chestnut, auburn, piss-burnt, and gray. Red was
deemed a &ldquo;disagreeable colour&rdquo; for hair and was rarely if
ever used in wigs.</p>
<p>The styles here shown were all popular at some time
during the eighteenth century, though perhaps some of
them were worn more often in England and France than in
the colonies. On the other hand, a popular colonial style,
the &ldquo;Albemarle&rdquo; wig, is not in our catalogue because nothing
has been found to tell what it looked like.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Bob wig." width="328" height="211" />
</div>
<p>No eighteenth-century illustration
of a bob wig, so labeled, has
been found. This picture, from
Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopedia</i> (like all
the others in this group) shows a
&ldquo;bonnet&rdquo; or &ldquo;short wig.&rdquo; The
brown dress bob favored by so
many of Edward Charlton&rsquo;s customers must have been
very similar. A plain bob presumably had fewer curls,
but neither it nor the dress bob would have had any queue
or hanging side curls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07b.jpg" alt="Brigadier wig." width="315" height="317" />
</div>
<p>This &ldquo;brigadier wig&rdquo; shows
what a few of Charlton&rsquo;s patrons
ordered from him. It was known
also as a major wig and a military
wig. The &ldquo;tye wig&rdquo; mentioned in
Charlton&rsquo;s accounts must have
looked very much like this (again
we lack any clear contemporary
illustration) except that it had
more than two curls tied at the nape of the neck.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" alt="Queue wig" width="335" height="370" />
</div>
<p>What Charlton called a &ldquo;queue
wig&rdquo; might have been any wig
with a tail&mdash;or even with two,
like this double pigtail. The tails
were usually bound tightly with
black ribbon, though sailors used
leather. A single queue, braided
but not bound, with a large bow
at the top and a small bow at the
bottom, was known as a &ldquo;Ramillies
wig&rdquo; after the battle at that place
(1706). The wearer of a Ramillies often doubled the end
of the queue back up to the wig and held it with a comb or
ribbon.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07e.jpg" alt="Bag wig" width="343" height="531" />
</div>
<p>In the &ldquo;bag wig&rdquo; the long hair
at the back was simply tied inside
a black taffeta bag, usually with
a rosette of black ribbon for decoration.
In England and France
this style, like so many others, was
carried to such an extreme that
the bag eventually covered the
wearer&rsquo;s entire shoulders. The
exaggeration at least had the virtue of protecting
his clothing from the pomade and powder of
the wig. It was going out of fashion in Virginia
by Charlton&rsquo;s time. Note the small strap and
buckle on the wig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="Square wig." width="352" height="302" />
</div>
<p>By the time of Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopedia</i>,
the &ldquo;square wigs&rdquo; shown
here were the nearest remnants
of the full-bottomed wigs that had
gone out of style about 1740. These
last can still be seen, however, in
portraits of royalty and nobility
of the seventeenth century and
early years of the eighteenth, and of course the style still
holds for English judges when they are on the bench.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08b.jpg" alt="Natural wig." width="334" height="353" />
</div>
<p>This, incredibly, was called a
&ldquo;natural wig,&rdquo; and was supposed
to resemble the wearer&rsquo;s own hair.
It fell down behind in long, straight
locks, ending either with a single
roll, or tapering away into a series
of ringlets.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08d.jpg" alt="Knotted wig." width="335" height="272" />
</div>
<p>The resemblance between this
&ldquo;knotted wig&rdquo; and its distant predecessor,
the full-bottomed wig,
may not be apparent at first
glance. The flowing locks of the
full-bottomed and campaign wigs
(the latter having two long curls
falling to the front of each
shoulder) were inconvenient to
travelers, sportsmen, and soldiers.
So they adopted the habit of
knotting up the curls on both sides
and tying together those in back;
eventually this expedient became
a style in its own right, but with
a single corkscrew curl in back.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;cadogan&rdquo; or &ldquo;club wig,&rdquo;
its name attributed to the first
Earl of Cadogan, became popular
in England in the 1770s,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
especially with the foppish young men who called themselves
&ldquo;Macaronis&rdquo; and went to absurd extremes in style,
wearing cadogans several times the size of this modest
example. The queue of straight hair was looped back on
itself and tied with string or ribbon to form a vertical bow
of hair.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08f.jpg" alt="Clerical wig." width="340" height="207" />
</div>
<p>This is the kind of clerical wig,
with built-in tonsure, that Roman
Catholic clergy in France wore. Anglican
clerics in Virginia, as Charlton&rsquo;s
accounts testify, wore brown
dress bobs just like those of so
many of their parishioners.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>THE MAKING OF A WIG</i></span></h2>
<p>The eighteenth-century wig was built up of rows of hair
woven at the root ends to cross-threads, each row being
then sewn to a net-and-ribbon skullcap or &ldquo;caul.&rdquo; The
steps in making a queue wig would differ, of course, in some
detail from those in making a wig without a queue. But
the basic procedures in the eighteenth-century manner of
perukemaking are the same for any style, and can be set
forth briefly under the following seven headings:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Taking the Measurements</i>&mdash;The customer&rsquo;s head (preferably
shaved) is measured with a strip of paper about an
inch wide, each measurement being recorded by a scissor-nick
in the edge of the strip. There are five essential dimensions
to take: (a) from the top center of the forehead over
the head to the nape of the neck; (b) from one temple to the
other around the back of the head; (c) over the top of the
head from ear to ear (to the top of the ears for a wig &ldquo;with
ears,&rdquo; i.e., with ears showing, to the middle of the ears for a
half-eared wig, and to the bottom of the ears for a full-bottomed
wig); (d) from the middle of either cheek to the
back of the head; and (e) from the top center of the forehead
to either temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="797" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The illustrations on this page come from Fran&ccedil;ois-Alexandre-Pierre de Garsault&rsquo;s <span class="f">The Art of the
Wigmaker</span>, published in France in 1767. At the top is a hackle, with two parcels of hair being
combed through it. Next are shears, curling pins, and a cylindrical oven for heating and drying
curls. The instrument below the hackle is a wigmaker&rsquo;s vise attached to a table top. Most prominent
in the lower picture is the six-thread weaving frame, with hair strands of two different
lengths tied to the lower threads. Above it and to the left are the various knots employed. The
odd-shaped pattern at the lower left with each parallel line bearing several numbers produced
a wig to fit the head of some eighteenth-century gentleman.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>(2) <i>Preparing the Hair</i>&mdash;Before it can be used in wigmaking,
hair must be cleaned, arranged according to length,
quality, and color, and curled. Tied in small parcels, the
hair is cleaned by thorough powdering with fine sand or
mill dust from a flour mill; this absorbs the oil and grease
from the hair and is then shaken out. Next the hair is
combed or carded through a &ldquo;hackle&rdquo; and separated into
parcels of different lengths. The wigmaker&rsquo;s vise, fixed to
the table top in a horizontal position, holds each parcel of
hair in turn (by the root ends) while the craftsman rolls the
hair&mdash;in a curl-paper&mdash;onto curling pins made of pipe clay.
These rolls he boils for three hours and then partially dries
in a small charcoal oven. The loaded curlers are then piled
up, taken to the bakery, covered with a shell of rye dough,
and baked in a moderate oven. When the loaf is returned
to the wig shop and broken open, the curls will have absorbed
some moisture from the dough and must again be
dried out in the charcoal oven. Finally dried and cooled,
the curled hair can be taken off the pins and combed out in
the hackle, further separated by lengths if necessary, and
the root ends of each parcel trimmed off evenly. If the
hair is thin and needs to be filled out with horsehair, or
if hair of different colors is to be mixed to achieve a desired
shade, this is the time to do it.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Making the Pattern</i>&mdash;The wigmaker&rsquo;s pattern is a
weaving pattern; it shows how many rows of hair will be
needed in a wig of the customer&rsquo;s size, how long each row
must be, and how long the hair in each part of each row must
be in order to make a wig of the desired style. On a piece of
squared paper the wigmaker draws as many parallel lines
as his measurements of the customer&rsquo;s head tell him are
needed. Each successive line will be longer or shorter, also,
as may be necessary to fit the customer&rsquo;s head. On each
line&mdash;or portion of a line&mdash;he marks the length of hair he
will use in that part of the wig. In determining this the
wigmaker relies partly on his own experience, partly on pattern
books or similar sources.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>(4) <i>Weaving the Hair</i>&mdash;The rows of hair are woven on a
simple frame of two upright posts holding three (or six)
silk threads stretched tight. The wigmaker takes several
strands of hair by the root ends and weaves them around
the silk warp threads, using one of a number of possible
weaves. He continues weaving a few strands at a time,
sliding the woven strands tight together until he has a strip
of weft as long as the pattern calls for. He winds the
finished strip onto one post as more thread unwinds from
the other, and does another row. If the frame holds six
threads, the lower three are used for the right side of the
wig (with the curl of the hair toward the weaver) and the
upper three for the left side (with the hair curling away from
the weaver).</p>
<p>(5) <i>Mounting the Caul</i>&mdash;From his assortment of hollowed
out elm or ash wig blocks of different sizes and shapes the
wigmaker selects the one that corresponds to the customer&rsquo;s
head measurements. On it he outlines the proposed wig in
inch-wide &ldquo;mounting ribbon&rdquo; of silk, carefully measuring,
stretching, folding, and lightly tacking as he goes. Then he
fixes the ribbon firmly in place with strong thread stretched
around two rows of small nails, called &ldquo;wig points,&rdquo; one
row on either side of the ribbon. Next he sews a fine net of
cotton or silk to the mounting ribbon all around, with
appropriate folds and tucks to fit the curvature of the wig
block, and trims off the excess. He then adds two strips of
&ldquo;covering ribbon&rdquo; three and a half inches wide across the
top of the wig, one from front to back, the other from side
to side, basting them to the net and sewing them firmly to
the mounting ribbon. He may add a drawstring or even a
small strap and buckle at the back so the wearer can keep
his wig on tighter.</p>
<p>(6) <i>Sewing the Strip of Weft to the Caul</i>&mdash;Following his
pattern for length of rows and length of hair, the wigmaker
now sews to the caul the strips of weft he has previously
woven, using a simple straight stitch. Except for the rows
framing the face, which start at the front edge and go
backwards, the rows are sewn beginning at the bottom and
back and working upward and forward. Rows of short fine
hair are sewn very close together, the rest in parallel rows a
quarter of an inch apart. Different styles, of course, may
require a particular sequence of sewing the proper combination
of short, long, curled, straight, or horsehair tresses to
achieve the desired result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="760" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Here are a group of wig blocks, one on an adjustable stand for easy pinning of the caul, the
others with cauls in various stages of completion. Wigs not in use at the time or being taken
on the owner&rsquo;s travels were kept or carried in wig boxes like that shown.</i> <span class="small">GARSAULT</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>(7) <i>Finishing and Dressing the Wig</i>&mdash;As the words imply,
these processes call for the deft use of comb, fingers, curling
iron, and scissors to trim and shape each curl and each
bunch of straight hair to graceful perfection. Finally, the
wigmaker adds a rosette, a bag, or ribbons as the style
demands, and pomade, powder, and perfume to the customer&rsquo;s
desire. The powder, incidentally, may be had in
various colors and serves to maintain the wig in the proper
shade or tint of brown, black, gray, or white. In fact, blue
powder was not unknown.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>STYLES AND PRICES</i></span></h2>
<p>If brown dress bob wigs at 43 shillings each were by far
the most popular of Edward Charlton&rsquo;s products&mdash;he sold
sixty in one year&mdash;they were by no means the only style he
made. Perukes not only came in almost endless variety;
their prices differed likewise. Even wigs of the same style
from the same maker could vary widely in price (according
to the kind and quality of materials, care in workmanship,
etc.) as the accompanying advertisement shows.</p>
<p>Clendinning&rsquo;s prices were in the same range as those
charged by Williamsburg wigmakers through most of the
eighteenth century. It is worth remark that Charlton&rsquo;s
price for a brown dress bob wig was the same in 1770 as
Andrew Anderson had charged in 1752 and as Jean Pasteur
had received in 1726, though the earlier models were probably
more elaborate than Charlton made.</p>
<p>From prices charged for various articles of clothing at the
same period, it appears that a man could outfit himself with
hat, coat, shirt, breeches, hose, and shoes for about what
his wig would cost him. Put another way, a suitably cheap
wig might easily cost a journeyman his wages for two to
three weeks, while a wealthy planter might pay nearly as
much for one &ldquo;Grisell Tye Wig&rdquo; as a servant&rsquo;s board cost
for a year.</p>

<p>Charlton&rsquo;s account book shows that shaving and dressing
also came at different prices according to the services given.
The charge for a year usually amounted to two pounds three
shillings. It might, however, be as little as the one pound
five shillings that Peter Pelham twice incurred or as much
as the four pounds that Speaker Randolph paid. Pelham,
organist at Bruton Parish Church and keeper of the colony&rsquo;s
gaol, found time in a busy life to father a family of sixteen
children but never got around to paying his little debt to
the barber. The account book shows it, along with 13
years&rsquo; accrued interest, still unpaid in 1784.</p>
<p>Besides the 60 brown dress bobs he made in 1770&mdash;seemingly
a typical year for him&mdash;Charlton sold 20 brown
dress queue wigs, three grizzle bobs, one each of three other
styles, made curls or dressed ladies&rsquo; hair on 28 occasions,
and had 42 annual customers for shaving and dressing.
During the court or Assembly sessions many additional
patrons demanded these last services. All of his 1770
business should have brought Charlton well over &pound;300
in 1771, when most payments would have been made.
Actually he received roughly &pound;260 in that year, with the
balance probably dribbling in over the next decade&mdash;or in
some cases never paid.</p>
<p>The difficulties of debt collection were among the reasons
why so many colonial Virginia craftsmen sought to augment
their income by branching into some other activity. Williamsburg
wigmakers favored innkeeping as their second
occupation. No fewer than five operated ordinaries or provided
lodgings, and one of them, Robert Lyon, moved on
to become a merchant. David Cunningham served as the
town constable for several years, and Alexander Finnie, of
course, left the wig trade entirely to become host of the
Raleigh Tavern.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>A facsimile of Andrew Anderson&rsquo;s bill to Colonel Thomas Jones, then of Williamsburg,

servants, during 1741, 1742, and 1743. Note that there are more entries for pulling
teeth and bleeding the sick than for making and dressing wigs. (Reproduced by

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>In addition to wigmaking, shaving, and hairdressing,
Andrew Anderson practiced dentistry and phlebotomy
(bleeding). But these were traditional phases of the barbering
craft, not extra occupations&mdash;albeit only Anderson
among Williamsburg barbers practiced them so far as we
know.</p>
<p>Charlton at one time took a flier in real estate along
with John Stretch, bookbinder and bookkeeper in William
Hunter&rsquo;s printing office. The partners bought the playhouse
and lot (about where Mrs. Campbell&rsquo;s Tavern now
stands) from Lewis Hallam, proprietor of the Company of
Comedians recently from London. The evidence is inconclusive,
but suggests that the venture was not a glittering
success.</p>
<p>From time to time Charlton recorded the sale of such
items as a &ldquo;Ferkin of butter,&rdquo; a gross of bottles (apparently
empty), &ldquo;eight pounds Chooklate,&rdquo; stockings, &ldquo;five Hundred
Limes,&rdquo; a piece of linen, three dozen strong beer, one
&ldquo;cheas,&rdquo; and part of a lottery ticket. However intriguing
these entries may be, they are too infrequent and irregular
to support a conclusion that the barber was running a
retail store on the side. When so much business was done
by barter, any craftsman might have incongruous articles
to sell.</p>
<p>Like the Silversmith James Geddy, Jr., and other craftsmen
of Williamsburg, Charlton once served on the city&rsquo;s
common council. This position carried no compensation,
but election to it showed that a man&rsquo;s neighbors trusted
and respected him.</p>
<p>The tradition of the humble artisan whose industry and
integrity earned him the esteem of his fellow citizens ran
strong in colonial America. Unfortunately for the wigmakers,
however, no bulwark could withstand the ebb tide
of fashion. George Lafong, whose Williamsburg wig shop
rivaled Charlton&rsquo;s in the early 1770s, ended as a beggar in
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
1796. Someone, it seems, must pay the price for every
forward step in the march of progress. Were it not so, all
of us might still be wearing wigs today.</p>

<p class="revint"><i>Andrew Anderson</i>&mdash;Apprenticed for seven years to John
Peter Wagnon of Williamsburg in 1731. After only
five years became his own master and bought Wagnon&rsquo;s
shop next to the Raleigh Tavern. The only Williamsburg
barber known to have practiced dentistry and
phlebotomy. Frequently in court as witness, plaintiff,
or defendant in suits over property, debts, etc. Sold
out to William Peake, Yorktown barber and wigmaker,
and was preparing to leave for England when he died
suddenly in 1752.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Stephen Besouth</i>&mdash;Died April 3, 1726, leaving an estate
appraised at &pound;40 12<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> and consisting almost solely
of articles suitable to barbering and wigmaking.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Daniel Blouett</i>&mdash;Arrived in Virginia in 1700 as a Huguenot
refugee. Bought a lot in Williamsburg in 1713, the
deed identifying him as a &ldquo;Peruke-Maker.&rdquo; Died in
1720. His name was variously spelled (or misspelled)
in different records: Blouet, Bluet, Bleuet, Blewitt,
Blewit, Blewet, Blouett, and Blouette.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>John Borton</i>&mdash;The <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of March 3, 1768, published
a list of letters in the post office waiting to be
claimed by their addressees. One was for &ldquo;John Borton,
perukemaker, Williamsburg.&rdquo; Nothing more is known
of him.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Simon Brazier</i>&mdash;A partner of Anthony Geohegan, Williamsburg
barber and wigmaker, from April to about November
1768.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p class="revint"><i>John Bryan</i>&mdash;A partner of Alexander Maitland in the
wigmaking craft in 1752 and later sole proprietor of a
shop on Williamsburg&rsquo;s main street. Possibly moved
away from the town in 1756.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Edward Charlton</i>&mdash;In 1752, soon after arriving from London,
became a partner of Richard Gamble in the latter&rsquo;s
shop next door to the Raleigh Tavern. Continued the
business after Gamble&rsquo;s death and was the town&rsquo;s
foremost wigmaker until the Revolution. Died sometime
between 1783 and 1792.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Richard Charlton</i>&mdash;Presumably related to Edward. Probably
was not himself a barber or wigmaker, but was
briefly an inactive partner of James Nichols, Williamsburg
wigmaker, and on occasion purveyed wigs to
customers of his well-patronized tavern.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>David Cunningham</i>&mdash;In addition to barbering and wigmaking,
operated an ordinary (inn) at his house near
the Capitol and for several years served as constable
of Williamsburg. Died in 1720.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>James Currie</i>&mdash;Took over in 1752 the former shop of Andrew
Anderson in partnership with William Peake of Yorktown.
Later moved across the street to his own shop.
Ordered in 1759 to pay the support of &ldquo;Mary Seveney&rsquo;s
Bastard Child.&rdquo; May have left town thereafter, as his
shop and the lot it stood on were sold in 1761.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>William Davenport</i>&mdash;An inventoried appraisal of his estate
in 1770 listed a number of items used by barbers and
wigmakers.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Mr. Davidson</i>&mdash;The register of Bruton Parish Church in
Williamsburg records the death on October 1, 1749, of
&ldquo;Mr. Davidson&mdash;the Barber.&rdquo; Nothing more is known
of him.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>William Duncan</i>&mdash;Was an indentured servant in 1753 of
Robert Lyon, Williamsburg wigmaker. Died two
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
years later, leaving an estate appraised by three other
wigmakers at &pound;28 and consisting mostly of wigmaking
articles and supplies.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Alexander Finnie</i>&mdash;Seemingly successful as wigmaker, tavernkeeper,
and property-owner. Advertised in 1745
for two or three journeymen, luring one from Andrew
Anderson, and imported more the next year. Acquired
the Raleigh Tavern in 1749 and the new (second)
theater in 1751, actively managing the former until he
sold both properties in 1752. At his death in 1769 also
owned Porto Bello plantation outside Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Richard Gamble</i>&mdash;From 1743 onward regularly cited in court
records for failing to attend church and to pay debts.
In 1752 took Edward Charlton into partnership to
run his shop next to the Raleigh. Died in 1755 leaving
no known family or real property and only &pound;14 worth
of barbering and wigmaking articles.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Anthony Geohegan</i>&mdash;Opened shop next door to Mrs. Vobe&rsquo;s
tavern across from the Raleigh in 1768. Took Simon
Brazier briefly into partnership the same year. Moved
to Richmond sometime between 1770 and 1775, having
in the meantime married Martha Lavia, Williamsburg
widow.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>William Godfrey</i>&mdash;Announced in 1766 that he had opened
shop between the Raleigh Tavern and the Capitol.
Nothing more is known of his wigmaking activities,
but he figured in several court cases during the following
seven years.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Thomas Hewitt</i>&mdash;Was an indentured servant of Robert Lyon
in 1753 and may have had his own shop in Williamsburg
before moving to Annapolis about 1762.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Cuthbert Hubbard</i>&mdash;In 1771 advertised that he was still
carrying on his wigmaking business in addition to offering
lodgings. Died in 1779. His will mentioned only
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
two articles used by wigmakers and the inventory of
his estate listed none.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>George Lafong</i>&mdash;Kept shop in Williamsburg from 1762 to
1783, at one time selling a pair of curls to Patsy Custis,
Washington&rsquo;s stepdaughter. Advertised on several occasions
for a journeyman to help him, and in 1777 took
Alexander Wiley into partnership. Nineteen years
later Lafong turned up as a beggar on the streets of
Norfolk.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Walter Lennox</i>&mdash;First appeared in Williamsburg court records
in 1759. From 1768 had his shop at the Sign of
the Red Lion, where he also offered lodgings. His
frequent advertisements for a journeyman indicate that
he did a lively business. Lodged and boarded sick
soldiers in the Revolution and supplied provisions to
the army.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Robert Lyon</i>&mdash;In various businesses from 1749 to 1771, first
as barber and wigmaker. Took up tavernkeeping at
the Sign of Edinburgh Castle, near the Capitol, in
1755. Four years later had become a merchant whose
store faced on Market Square.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Alexander Maitland</i>&mdash;With his partner, John Bryan, advertised
wigmaking services once in 1752. Thereafter

<p class="revint"><i>James Martin</i>&mdash;Court records and the like show him to have
been in Williamsburg from 1760 to 1766; he never
advertised in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>. At his death he
left a large estate including 18 wigs and other barbering
articles as well as items that point strongly to his being
also a tavernkeeper.</p>
<p class="revint"><i>James Nichols</i>&mdash;Coming from London, he opened shop first
in Petersburg in 1772 and three years later in Williamsburg.

<p class="revint"><i>William Peake</i>&mdash;A Yorktown barber, wigmaker, and dealer
in imported wigmaking supplies who made a brief
appearance in Williamsburg, first opening shop in the
tavern of William Dunn, then buying the old shop of
Andrew Anderson and taking into partnership James
Currie. Currie seems to have run the Williamsburg
end of the combine while Peake returned to Yorktown.</p>

show that he was paid for shaving and a wig in 1748.
Nothing more is known of his barbering or wigmaking
activity.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
